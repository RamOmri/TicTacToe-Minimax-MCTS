# TicTacToe-Minimax-MCTS
This project utilizes both the minimax algorithm and the MCTS algorithm to play a game of tic tac toe on a grid of variable size (although a grid size larger than 3 is infeasible for minimax).
To utilise the project:
1. yarn install
2. yarn build-tree generates a json file of the minimax tree graph which can be used to find the optimal move for every possible game state.
3. The TicTacToeMCTS function can be deployed on whichever platform best suites and given a gamestate and player outputs a game state with the optimal move using a monte carlo tree search. 

Find a demonstration of how the TicTacToeMCTS function and minimax tree graph are implemented here:
